# NNFPF
Non-Newtonian fluid flow through a fracture partially-filled with a porous proppant

* NNFPF is a finite-difference MATLAB tool for the simulation of 
  two-dimensional, non-newtonian, flow through a fracture partially filled 
  with porous proppant pillars (NNFPF). The code is capable of simulating 
  flow through smooth and rough fractures.
